# battleship

HOW IT WORKS:

BATTLESHIPGAME.JAVA
1. The "BattleShipGame" class is responsible for the logic of the game.
2. It initializes a Scanner and an "ArrayList" with "targets" to keep track of the ship locations that remain.
3. Constructors are used to make the array of battleships that include their name and locations.
4. The game loops until all locations are hit. Messages are printed out in the console according to the user input.

BATTLESHIP.JAVA
1. The "BattleShip" class is responsible for the actual battleship.
2. The fields contain the name and the location of the battleship with constructors initialized.
3. A method is used to check the user's guess by matching the coordinates to any of the battleship's locations.

GAMEHELPER.JAVA
1. This essentially sets up the board for the game to be played on.
