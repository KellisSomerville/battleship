+# battleship
+
+HOW IT WORKS:
+
+BATTLESHIPGAME.JAVA
+1. The "BattleShipGame" class is responsible for the logic of the game.
+2. It initializes a Scanner and an "ArrayList" with "targets" to keep track of the ship locations that remain.
+3. Constructors are used to make the array of battleships that include their name and locations.
+4. The game loops until all locations are hit. Messages are printed out in the console according to the user input.
+
+BATTLESHIP.JAVA
+1. The "BattleShip" class is responsible for the actual battleship.
+2. The fields contain the name and the location of the battleship with constructors initialized.
+3. A method is used to check the user's guess by matching the coordinates to any of the battleship's locations.
+
+GAMEHELPER.JAVA
+1. This essentially sets up the board for the game to be played on.
